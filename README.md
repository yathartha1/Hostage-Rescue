# Hostage-Rescue
A fun hostage rescue game in which two terrorists have taken an old lady as hostage in her own house. Its up to the player to tackle those terrorists and rescue the old lady.
In this game, whenever the player enters a room, he/she is presented with different doorways in different directions. Depending on the directions chosen by the player, he/she can either come face to face with a terrorist or can be led to the room where the hostage is kept or can enter an empty room.
This game is purely voice based with some aspect of decision making in it which makes it so fun.
